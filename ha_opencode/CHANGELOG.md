# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 2.2.34

- **Expand legacy config migration** — Now catches `python3.*ha-mcp` and `server.py` patterns in addition to `/usr/share/ha-mcp`, covering more variants of old python-based MCP configs that crash opencode on startup.
- **Fix touch-scroll iframe leak** — `preventDefault()` now fires immediately on active drag instead of after the 22px tick threshold. Prevents sub-threshold gestures from leaking to the HA ingress iframe.

## 2.2.33

- **Unify license to MIT** — All references updated from Unlicense to MIT across OCI labels, package.json, DOCS.md, THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md. Added regression tests for license consistency.
- **Fix version shield in README** — Changed from GitHub release API badge to manual version badge that `update-version-shield.sh` can update. Script now handles `?style=for-the-badge` suffix. Added test to prevent future pattern drift.
- **Fix `latest` update policy shadowed by bundled PATH** — `opencode-session.sh` now only overrides PATH with `/usr/local/bin` when policy is `bundled`. Previously the override always won, so the runtime-installed opencode at `/data/.npm-global/bin` was never used even with `latest` policy.
- **Correct DOCS.md default for update policy** — DOCS.md now states `bundled` as the default (matching config.yaml). Added test to detect config/docs default drift for both stable and beta addons.
- **Remove dead `mobile_proxy_enabled` option** — The option, schema, and translation were still present but no service reads it (the mobile proxy was removed in 2.2.29). Cleanup reduces config clutter.
- **Harden Chromium runtime install** — Added 10-minute timeout and graceful fallback (disables screenshots for the boot instead of hanging indefinitely). Previously the apt-get install had no timeout and could block init-opencode forever on slow networks.
- **Update beta addon manifest** — Bumped version from 2.1.1b0 to 2.2.32b0, added missing `tmpfs: true`, updated image/URL references from magnusoverli to umrath.
- **Consolidate registry/URL references** — Replaced remaining `magnusoverli/opencode` references with `umrath/hass-opencode` in README.md, build.yaml, DOCS.md (both addons), and GH Actions workflows. Added test to prevent regression.

## 2.2.32

- **Mobile/touch scrolling in the terminal** — OpenCode runs as a full-screen TUI with mouse reporting on, so on phones and tablets a touch drag did nothing and the view was stuck. A small script (injected into ttyd's page like the clipboard glue) now translates a one-finger vertical drag into mouse-wheel events at the touch point, so OpenCode scrolls via the same path the desktop wheel already uses. No-op on desktop; tmux session persistence is unaffected (no proxy/dual-terminal reintroduced).

## 2.2.31

- **Fix OpenCode TUI crashing to a shell (`An error occurred in Effect.tryPromise`)** — the real cause: `/tmp` is mounted `noexec` (the add-on sets `tmpfs: true`), so when OpenCode/Bun extracted its native `opentui` terminal renderer (~10 MB `.so`) to `/tmp` and mapped it executable, the kernel refused it and the interactive terminal crashed at start-up. (`opencode run`/`serve` don't load the renderer, which is why they worked.) Bun is now pointed at an exec-capable `TMPDIR=/data/tmp` (set in the session launcher and a profile.d script; created and cleaned each boot). The terminal now opens normally.

## 2.2.30

- **Fix OpenCode crashing to a shell (`An error occurred in Effect.tryPromise`)** — a project config left behind by old add-on versions at `/homeassistant/.opencode/opencode.json` (it pointed the MCP server at the long-removed `/usr/share/ha-mcp/server.py`) is rejected by current OpenCode and aborted start-up whenever the working directory was `/homeassistant`. The add-on no longer writes that file; on start-up it now detects the legacy marker, archives the file to a `.bak` alongside it, and lets the managed config take over. Upgraded installs that hit the crash are repaired automatically.

## 2.2.29

- **Fix add-on stuck on `[exited]` (terminal reconnect loop)** — the real root cause was that `opencode-session.sh` was not executable, so every terminal session died instantly with `Permission denied`, ending the tmux session and making ttyd respawn in a tight loop. The script is now marked executable (in source and defensively in the image build). This affected all previous versions.
- **Simplify terminal to a single ttyd** — removed the mobile/desktop proxy + dual-ttyd + touch-probe layer (the mobile/desktop switch never worked reliably) in favour of one ttyd bound directly to the ingress port (`0.0.0.0:8099`) running the OpenCode session in tmux. This is the standard, proven HA web-terminal setup.

## 2.2.28

- **Fix add-on failing to start (`[exited]`)** — the `init-opencode` one-shot can no longer take the whole container down: its s6 `up` now always reports success, so a transient boot-step failure degrades a feature instead of stopping the add-on.
- **Fix OpenCode binary "not-found" under AppArmor** — the profile now allows the boot CPU-binary swap (`opencode.exe`) inside the `opencode-ai` package; previously AppArmor denied the `unlink`/`cp`, leaving a dangling binary.
- **Deterministic boot** — `opencode_update_policy` now defaults to `bundled` (use the image's OpenCode, no boot-time `npm install`), avoiding network/OOM/timeout failures during start-up. Set it to `latest` to opt back into runtime updates.

## 2.2.27

- **Fix opencode binary permissions** — chmod native opencode binary in Dockerfile.

## 2.2.26

- **Remove watchdog:false** — may have been blocking HA Supervisor store display.

## 2.2.25

- **Fix opencode CLI** — create `opencode.exe` symlink at build time so bundled binary works without runtime init.

## 2.2.24

- **Remove `watchdog: false`** — may block older HA Supervisor versions.

## 2.2.23

- **All defect fixes from 2.2.19 audit** — W1 (non-proxy terminal), A1 (dead code removed), A2 (base image pinned + guard), R1 (arm64 worker with retry), R2 (CHANGELOG duplicate check).

## 2.2.22

- **Fix arm64 build** — dedicated BuildKit builder to prevent session cancellation.
- **Test coverage** — comprehensive shell syntax, JS syntax, LSP startup, clipboard.js.

## 2.2.21

- **Fix arm64 build** — reverted broken syntax. Shell-syntax now validated by unit tests.

## 2.2.20

- **Fix arm64 build** — detached with setsid to survive CI restarts. Arm64 now reliably merges into multi-arch manifest.

## 2.2.19

- **Use bundled opencode** — skip runtime npm update to avoid postinstall binary detection bugs.

## 2.2.18

- **s6-only supervision** — removed Docker HEALTHCHECK and HA Supervisor watchdog. s6 is the sole process supervisor.
- **Fix platform binary** — runtime npm install uses --ignore-scripts + manual binary install (same as Dockerfile).

## 2.2.17

- **Restore init-opencode dependency** — desktop and mobile ttyd now wait for config generation before starting, so opencode finds a valid opencode.json.

## 2.2.16

- **HEALTHCHECK always passes** — Docker health check no longer kills the container. HA Supervisor manages health independently.

## 2.2.15

- **Proxy starts before init** — removed init-opencode dependency so port 8099 binds immediately on container start.

## 2.2.14

- **Three-service s6 architecture** — replaced monolithic multiprocess bash with independent s6 services. Proxy, desktop ttyd, mobile ttyd each supervised individually.

## 2.2.13

- **Python terminal supervisor** — replaced fragile bash multi-process supervision (wait, kill -0, trap) with a clean Python supervisor. Single `exec python3` call, proper subprocess management.

## 2.2.12

- **Fix duplicate proxy startup** — removed duplicate `python3 proxy.py` call causing port 8099 conflict.
- **Test: single proxy instance** — enforced to prevent recurrence.

## 2.2.11

- **Fix watchdog restart loop** — extended HEALTHCHECK `--start-period` to 60s (was 5s). During the grace period the container reports as "starting" and HA Supervisor will not restart. Start proxy before ttyd so Ingress port 8099 binds immediately.

## 2.2.10

- **Fix LSP server crash** — added unhandledRejection/uncaughtException handlers.
- **Fix GITHUB_PATTERNS_URL** — updated from magnusoverli/opencode to umrath/hass-opencode.
- **Fix wait hang risk** — added `|| true` after `wait` in service trap handlers.
- **Fix discover-services error logging** — added console.error in main().catch to surface discovery failures.
- **Test coverage** — content protection tests for write_config_safe, MCP server startup tests, proxy lifecycle tests.

## 2.2.9

- **Fix watchdog restart loop** — replaced `wait -n` (spurious signal returns) with `kill -0` health check loop that logs which process died.
- **Proxy startup hardening** — readiness check, startup logging, lifecycle tests.

## 2.2.8

- **Fix proxy startup** — added readiness check and lifecycle tests.

## 2.2.7

- **Fix MCP server stability** — removed `process.exit` when SUPERVISOR_TOKEN is missing (server stays alive), increased MCP tool timeout from 10s to 60s.

## 2.2.6

- **Pre-baked base image** — split Dockerfile into base (apt, npm, pip) and app (COPY rootfs). App builds complete in under 30 seconds.

## 2.2.5

- **Fix MCP server crash** — moved unhandledRejection/uncaughtException handlers before module initialization to catch startup errors.
- **Fix watchdog restart loop** — added `wait` after `kill` in SIGTERM trap to prevent port races on service restart.

## 2.2.4

- **Fix watchdog restart loop** — added s6 finish script to kill orphaned ttyd processes on service stop. In mobile proxy mode, background ttyd processes would survive restarts and block ingress ports.

- **OpenCode runtime update policy** — added a `latest`/`bundled` update policy. By default the app installs `opencode-ai@latest` into persistent app data and uses that before the bundled fallback, while `bundled` disables OpenCode self-update and uses the image version only. Baseline CPU mode now logs VM CPU passthrough guidance and the known upstream baseline OOM issue.

## 2.2.3

- **Performance: Chromium at runtime** — removed chromium (~1 GB) from the Docker image. Installed only at first start when `screenshot_enabled=true`. Saves ~1 GB download and ~3 min build time for all users.
- **Decoupled image builds** — amd64 images build and publish immediately (~8 min); arm64 builds asynchronously via QEMU in the background. Releases are available for amd64 users without waiting for arm64.
- **Node.js 22** — switched to Node.js 22 (nodesource) for opencode-ai compatibility. Debian Trixie ships Node 20, but opencode-ai@latest requires ≥22.

## 2.2.2

- **Fix MCP server crash** — added `unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException` handlers to prevent the MCP server process from exiting on transient HA API errors. This fixes the recurring "-32000: connection closed" error.

## 2.2.1

- **Fix mobile proxy port mismatch** — proxy.py defaults (7681/7682/7683) did not match the ttyd ports (8099/8098/8097). Export correct ports via environment variables.

## 2.2.0

- **Mobile device support** — added an async Python TCP proxy with iPad touch-probe detection (via `navigator.maxTouchPoints`), routing mobile clients to a tmux-free terminal with larger font while desktop clients keep tmux session persistence. Toggle via `mobile_proxy_enabled`.

## 2.1.0

- **PPQ private TEE models (beta)** — added an opt-in internal PPQ private-mode proxy, pinned at image build time, with a masked PPQ API key option and an OpenCode custom provider for PPQ private models. This feature ships in the stable add-on, but should still be considered beta while provider behavior and proxy integration are validated.
- **Faster startup and lower resource use** — OpenCode service startup no longer waits on ESPHome/Zigbee2MQTT discovery, AGENTS.md guidance only refreshes after add-on updates, environment variables are processed in a single pass, the baseline x64 OpenCode binary is preinstalled for non-AVX2 systems, and `puppeteer-core` loads only when screenshots are used.
- **More responsive MCP and YAML LSP** — added API/documentation fetch timeouts, short-lived caches, failed-fetch backoff, concurrent template validation, WebSocket registry calls, compact large responses, lazy YAML completion docs, debounced diagnostics, and stale diagnostic cancellation.
- **Web terminal clipboard fixes** — copying inside OpenCode now reaches the browser clipboard through OSC 52/tmux/ttyd support, plain HTTP shows a one-click copy fallback, plain `Ctrl+V` paste works, and macOS users can use `Option+drag` to select text while full-screen terminal apps capture the mouse.
- **Multi-arch release and CI improvements** — stable/beta images now use Home Assistant's generic multi-arch image style and Debian base image, release image assets are attached to GitHub releases, GitHub Actions are Node 24-ready, and aarch64 builds run on native ARM runners.
- **Fixes** — corrected the `get_error_log` API path, restored YAML LSP service hover, prevented edits in one file from cancelling another file's diagnostics, and fixed release image asset uploads.

## 2.0.0

- **Optional LAN server mode** — added an opt-in setting that starts an OpenCode server on fixed internal port `4096`, with Home Assistant Network settings controlling any host port mapping. This allows remote clients to connect with `opencode attach` when the port is explicitly mapped. Thanks to [@benwestrate](https://github.com/benwestrate) for contributing this feature.
- **Masked access token field** — the Home Assistant access token option now uses a password-style configuration field in the add-on UI.

## 1.9.1

- **Opt-in serial device access** — added a `serial_devices` option that lets users map selected host UART/serial devices into the add-on for USB flashing and adapter inspection workflows. Supervisor `uart` and `udev` manifest flags remain disabled by default because they are static permissions, not runtime user options.

## 1.9.0

- Reduce memory and disk pressure by disabling OpenCode snapshots by default and ignoring noisy Home Assistant internal paths in OpenCode's file watcher.
- Improve Zigbee2MQTT URL configuration by documenting the required `http://` or `https://` scheme and automatically treating host/IP-only `z2m_url` values as `http://`.
- Add Home Assistant add-on development folder access by mounting `/addons` and `/addon_configs`, with an opt-in guidance setting and security warnings.

## 1.8.1

### Build: pin hab CLI to a released version

- **Pin hab CLI to `1.6.4`** — the add-on image previously built the [`hab` CLI](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-build-cli) from whatever commit happened to be on `main` at build time, which made builds non-reproducible and exposed users to unreviewed upstream changes. The Dockerfile now clones a specific release tag via a new `HAB_VERSION` build arg.
- **Update monitoring workflow** — `.github/workflows/check-hab-update.yaml` now compares the pinned `HAB_VERSION` against the latest upstream GitHub release and flags drift in the job summary, instead of reporting the latest `main` commit.

## 1.8.0

### Zigbee and Stability Improvements

- **New zigporter integration** - adds zigporter CLI tooling to the add-on for Zigbee migration and device management workflows, including a new `zigporter_run` MCP tool
- **Z2M discovery and configuration support** - startup now supports Zigbee2MQTT discovery plus optional `z2m_url` and `z2m_mqtt_topic` configuration for zigporter commands
- **Fix `screenshot_url` timeouts** - switched navigation wait strategy from `networkidle0` to `load` to avoid Home Assistant's persistent WebSocket causing guaranteed timeouts
- **Fix optional Z2M URL handling** - `z2m_url` now allows empty values so users are not blocked by validation when Zigbee2MQTT is not configured
- **Zigporter build behavior update** - zigporter is now installed as latest at image build time rather than pinning a fixed version

## 1.7.2

### hab CLI Documentation

Improved LLM context documentation to cover all hab CLI commands added in 1.7.1.

- **Fixed JSON/text flag documentation** — `--json` enables structured JSON output; text is the default. The previous docs had this inverted, which would cause errors for any agent following them.
- **Added missing command groups to AGENTS.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, and the `hab_run` tool description**: `scene`, `person`, `category`, `todo`, `notification`, `integration`, `repairs`, `event`, `template`, `entity logbook`, and `overview` — none of which were previously visible to the LLM
- **Added concrete examples** for every new command group in INSTRUCTIONS.md so agents know how to invoke them correctly

## 1.7.1

### hab CLI Update

This release rebuilds the container to pick up significant upstream improvements to the `hab` CLI ([balloob/home-assistant-build-cli](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-build-cli)).

**New command groups**

- **`todo`** — manage to-do lists and items (list, add, complete, uncomplete, update, remove)
- **`notification`** — list, create, and dismiss persistent notifications
- **`calendar`** — create and delete timed or all-day calendar events
- **`integration`** — list, get, reload, enable, and disable config entries
- **`event`** — list event types and fire custom events (JSON/YAML/file input supported)
- **`repairs`** — list HA repair issues with severity filtering; ignore/unignore
- **`scene`** — full CRUD plus `activate` with `--transition` support
- **`person`** — full CRUD with device tracker and user ID support
- **`category`** — full CRUD with scope inference from entity ID prefix; assign/remove
- **`template`** — render Jinja2 templates inline, from `--file`, or stdin
- **`entity logbook`** — read logbook entries with `--start`/`--end` filters

**Performance improvements**

- Entity list, overview, and automation list `--extended` now fire all API calls concurrently, reducing wall-clock time from multiple sequential round-trips to approximately one
- ESPHome `GetDevices` and `GetPing` calls parallelised
- CLI internals optimised: cached auth with `sync.Once`, atomic WebSocket message IDs, pre-allocated slices, zero-copy format detection

**ESPHome ingress fix**

- New `HAB_ESPHOME_TOKEN`, `HAB_ESPHOME_SESSION`, and `HA_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var overrides for ESPHome access through HA Core's ingress proxy (required since ESPHome ~2026.2.x in addon containers)

## 1.7.0

### Visual Verification (Screenshot Tool)

- **New `screenshot_url` MCP tool** — takes screenshots of any Home Assistant frontend page using headless Chromium, enabling AI models with vision capabilities to visually verify dashboard changes, card layouts, and UI modifications
- **Three-layer authentication** — uses localStorage token injection, WebSocket auth interception, and HTTP request header injection to reliably authenticate with the HA frontend regardless of version
- **Opt-in via configuration** — disabled by default to keep resource usage minimal. Enable via the `screenshot_enabled` option in the add-on Configuration tab
- **Requires Long-Lived Access Token** — uses the same `access_token` option already available for ESPHome tools to authenticate with the HA frontend
- **Configurable viewport** — supports custom width, height, render wait time, and full-page capture
- **HA Core URL auto-discovery** — extracted into a reusable `discoverHACoreUrl()` function shared with the ESPHome ingress discovery logic
- Chromium and puppeteer-core added to the container image

### MCP Server

- **34 tools** (was 33) — `screenshot_url` added to the tool set
- MCP server version bumped to v2.7.0
- New `createImageContent` helper in `lib/helpers.js` for building MCP image content objects

### CI/CD

- **New `dev` branch** for beta development — beta releases are now tagged and built from `dev`, stable releases from `main`
- Beta release workflow now syncs the entire `ha_opencode_beta/` directory (config, translations, changelog, docs) from dev to main automatically

## 1.6.2

### ESPHome Error Handling

- **Clear error when ESPHome tools are used without an access token** — previously produced a cryptic 500 error; now shows step-by-step setup instructions in the MCP tools, the `hab_run` gateway, and the shell ([#16](https://github.com/magnusoverli/opencode/issues/16))

### write_config_safe: Content Protection

Addresses [#14](https://github.com/magnusoverli/opencode/issues/14) — `configuration.yaml` could be overwritten when the AI wrote only a single integration without reading the existing file.

- **Top-level key preservation** — for mapping-based YAML files (e.g. `configuration.yaml`), `write_config_safe` now blocks any write that would remove existing top-level keys
- **Significant size reduction guard** — writes that would reduce any config file by more than 50% (by line count) are blocked
- **List-entry reduction** (existing) — protection for `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, and `scenes.yaml` remains, now integrated into the unified content protection system
- All three checks can be bypassed with `confirm_deletions: true` for intentional removals
- `.bak` files are now retained after successful writes as a recovery point

### Testing Infrastructure

- **102 unit tests** added across MCP server (66 tests) and LSP server (36 tests) using vitest
- Pure functions extracted into testable `lib/` modules:
  - MCP: `intelligence.js`, `validation.js`, `html-parser.js`, `helpers.js`
  - LSP: `yaml-analyzer.js`, `completions.js`
- Test files excluded from Docker image via `.dockerignore`

### Bug Fixes

- **watch_firmware_update**: `callApi()` → `callHA()` — was calling a non-existent function, causing firmware update monitoring to crash at runtime
- **LSP YAML context analyzer**: `currentIndent === prevIndent` → `currentIndent = prevIndent` — no-op comparison fixed to assignment, restoring correct parent key detection in nested YAML

### Cleanup

- **Removed: Web UI mode** — the experimental `ui_mode: web` option has been removed (never promoted to stable). TUI mode remains the only UI
- nginx removed from container image (reduces image size)

## 1.6.1

**ESPHome Connectivity Fix + hab CLI Shell Support**

ESPHome 2026.2+ moved its dashboard to a Unix socket behind nginx with IP-based access rules, breaking direct connections from addon containers. This release routes all ESPHome communication through HA Core's ingress proxy, restoring full functionality for both MCP tools and the hab CLI.

### ESPHome Ingress Integration
- **All ESPHome MCP tools working again** — `esphome_list_devices`, `esphome_compile`, and `esphome_upload` now route through HA Core's ingress proxy instead of connecting directly to the ESPHome container
- **hab CLI ESPHome commands working from shell** — `hab esphome list`, `hab esphome logs`, etc. now work when run directly from the terminal, not just through the MCP `hab_run` tool
- **New `access_token` configuration option** — a long-lived HA Core access token is required for ESPHome ingress authentication. Create one at Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens in the HA UI and paste it into the addon's Configuration tab. Only needed if you use ESPHome tools
- **Automatic HA Core URL discovery** — the addon auto-discovers your HA instance URL from `internal_url` in Settings → System → Network, with automatic fallback to network interface detection if the URL is set to "automatic"
- **WebSocket ingress session creation** — ingress sessions are created via HA Core's WebSocket API (the only method accepted by the Supervisor), using the long-lived access token for authentication

### Startup ESPHome Discovery
- New `discover-esphome.js` startup script runs the same 5-step discovery flow as the MCP server (find addon → get ingress entry → resolve HA Core URL → create WebSocket session → build URL) and writes `HAB_ESPHOME_URL` and `HAB_ESPHOME_SESSION` to the environment so `hab esphome` commands work from the shell
- Discovery is best-effort at addon startup — if ESPHome is not installed, not running, or the access token is missing, it skips silently

### Other Changes
- **Bumped `hassio_role` to `manager`** — required for ingress session creation via the Supervisor API
- **Safer automation editing in AGENTS.md** — AI instructions now require reading all existing automations before writing to `automations.yaml`, preventing accidental overwrites
- **Beta channel infrastructure** — added `ha_opencode_beta` addon directory and CI workflows for beta releases, enabling faster testing of experimental changes

## 1.6.0

**hab CLI from Source + Debian Trixie Base Image**

- **Upgraded base image to Debian Trixie** — migrated from `bookworm` (Debian 12) to `trixie` (Debian 13), bringing Node.js 18 → 20, git 2.39 → 2.47, glibc 2.36 → 2.41, and newer versions of jq, curl, and tmux
- **hab CLI built from source** — hab is now compiled from the [main branch](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-build-cli) at each add-on release via a multi-stage Docker build, replacing the previous pinned release binary. This ensures the latest features and fixes are always included without waiting for upstream releases
- **Removed daily/weekly release-tracking workflows** — the automated version-bump PRs (`update-hab-cli.yaml`, `check-hab-update.yaml`) have been replaced with a lightweight weekly status check that reports the latest commit on main

## 1.5.3

**hab CLI: Automated Update Tracking + Live Command Discovery**

- **Automated hab update detection** — new weekly GitHub Actions workflow checks for new [hab CLI](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-build-cli) releases every Monday and opens a pull request automatically, keeping the version pins in `build.yaml` and `Dockerfile` in sync. Can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab.
- **Dynamic hab help injection** — at container startup, `hab --help` output is injected live into `AGENTS.md` between sentinel markers, so the AI always sees the exact commands available in the installed hab version — no manual documentation update needed when hab gains new features
- **Note for users who saw missing icons after the 1.5.2 repo rename**: a standard update is not sufficient to restore them — uninstall and reinstall the add-on once to refresh the Supervisor icon cache

## 1.5.2

**Rename: GitHub repository `ha_opencode` -> `opencode`**

- Renamed GitHub repository from `magnusoverli/ha_opencode` to `magnusoverli/opencode`
- All old URLs auto-redirect via GitHub — no action needed for existing users
- Updated all repository URL references across config, docs, CI, and README
- Reverted the directory rename from v1.5.1 — add-on directory must match slug for icon/logo discovery

## 1.5.1

**Fix: Restore add-on logo in Home Assistant update notifications**

- Reverted directory rename (`opencode/` back to `ha_opencode/`) — HA Supervisor requires the directory name to match the add-on slug for icon/logo discovery

## 1.5.0

**Renamed to OpenCode + hab CLI Integration**

Based on feedback from [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob):

- **Renamed from "HA OpenCode" to "OpenCode"** across all user-facing surfaces (sidebar panel, add-on store, logs, banner, docs, build labels)
- **MCP enabled by default** — the Home Assistant MCP integration is now on out of the box, no manual toggle needed
- **Integrated [hab CLI](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant-build-cli)** (Home Assistant Builder v1.4.0) — a CLI by balloob designed for AI agents to manage HA via REST and WebSocket APIs
  - Installed as a pre-authenticated binary (amd64 + aarch64)
  - Exposed as a native MCP tool (`hab_run`) so the AI discovers it alongside existing tools — no bash guesswork needed
  - Covers dashboard CRUD, area/floor/zone/label management, helper creation, automation management via API, script management, backup/restore, blueprints, calendar, device management, groups, and search
  - Security: uses `execFile` (no shell injection), blocks auth/self-update commands
- **AGENTS.md auto-update** — on add-on update, AGENTS.md is refreshed with the latest AI instructions unless the user has customized it
- Available in the shell help after exiting OpenCode (`hab <cmd>`)
- MCP tool count: 32 → 33

## 1.4.4

**Fix: write_config_safe now blocks writes when HA config check is unavailable**

- `write_config_safe` previously treated a failed HA config check API call as a success,
  leaving unvalidated config on disk. The tool now restores the original file (or removes
  the newly written file) whenever the validation result is anything other than an explicit
  `"valid"` from HA Core — including when the check API is unreachable or returns an error.
- Removed overreaching "will never fail to start" guarantees from documentation and agent
  instructions. Claims now accurately reference the multi-layered guardrails (deprecation
  scanning, Jinja2 pre-validation, structural checks, backup/restore, HA Core config check)
  rather than making absolute promises.
- Expanded DOCS.md to cover `env_vars`, `cpu_mode`, and `opencode_config` configuration options.

## 1.4.2

**Feature: User-Defined Environment Variables**

- Added `env_vars` configuration option to pass custom environment variables into the container
  - Supports any key/value pair (e.g. `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  - Variables are available to OpenCode, the terminal shell, and all child processes
  - Configurable from the add-on's Configuration tab in Home Assistant
- Security hardening:
  - Variable names validated against strict shell identifier regex
  - Critical system variables (`HOME`, `PATH`, `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`, etc.) are blocked from being overridden
  - Values are single-quote escaped to prevent shell injection
  - File permissions set to 600 and excluded from backups to protect secrets
- Removed unused legacy `run.sh` entry point (dead code cleanup)

Closes #12

## 1.4.1

**CI: Prevent redundant builds and fix release notes extraction**

- Added `[skip ci]` to the automated version bump commit in the release workflow, preventing unnecessary CI runs when the release bot pushes to `main`
- Fixed changelog extraction in release workflow — the `awk` range pattern was matching the section header as both start and end, producing empty release notes

## 1.4.0

**Safe Config Writing & Multi-Layered Validation Pipeline**

This release adds a comprehensive config validation system with multiple layers of protection against AI-written configuration causing your Home Assistant to fail to start. Inspired by community feedback on making AI coding agents safe for production HA instances.

### New MCP Tool: `write_config_safe`
- Writes YAML config files with automatic validation and backup/restore
- If validation fails after writing, the original file is automatically restored
- Supports `dry_run` mode to pre-validate config without touching disk
- Validates through multiple layers before committing:
  - Deprecation pattern scanning (20+ patterns)
  - Jinja2 template pre-validation through HA's own template engine
  - Structural YAML checks (automations need triggers/actions, scripts need sequences, etc.)
  - YAML lint checks (tabs, comma-separated entity lists, multiline issues)
  - Full HA Core config check (`POST /config/core/check_config`)
- Path traversal protection — blocks writes to internal directories (`.storage`, `.cloud`, etc.)

### Dynamic Validation Data Sources
- **GitHub remote patterns** — deprecation patterns are fetched from the repo hourly, allowing updates between add-on releases
- **HA Repairs API** — queries your installation's active repair/deprecation warnings via WebSocket (`repairs/list_issues`)
- **HA Alerts feed** — checks `alerts.home-assistant.io` for known integration issues affecting your config
- All remote sources have timeouts, caching (1 hour TTL), and graceful fallback to bundled data

### LSP Real-Time Deprecation Warnings
- The LSP server now surfaces deprecated syntax as yellow squigglies while editing YAML files
- Shares the same pattern database as the MCP server for consistency
- Also fetches updated patterns from GitHub in the background

### Shared Deprecation Pattern Database
- Extracted deprecation patterns from MCP server into a shared JSON file (`rootfs/opt/shared/deprecation-patterns.json`)
- Both MCP and LSP servers load from the same source
- Expanded from 10 to 20 patterns, adding coverage for:
  - Legacy MQTT platform syntax (`platform: mqtt` under domain keys)
  - Direct state object access (`states.sensor.x.state` — use `states('sensor.x')`)
  - Direct attribute access (`states.sensor.x.attributes` — use `state_attr()`)
  - `entity_id` inside `data:` (should use `target:`)
  - `hassio` service domain (renamed to `homeassistant`)
  - String format `for:` durations (should use dict format)
  - Legacy `value_template` key (modern template sensors use `state:`)

### Updated Agent Instructions
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` updated with mandatory `write_config_safe` workflow
- `AGENTS.md` updated with new tool references and deprecation guidance
- MCP server version bumped to v2.6.0 (Safe Config Edition), tool count 31 → 32

## 1.3.7

**Housekeeping: Licensing, CI, and Documentation**

- Added missing `ws`, `prettier`, and Home Assistant base image entries to `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`, including the Apache-2.0 license text for the HA base image
- Contributor mentions in the changelog are now linked directly to GitHub profiles
- Split CI build workflow into separate per-architecture jobs (`build-aarch64.yaml`, `build-amd64.yaml`) to enable independent build status badges in the README
- CI workflow runs now include the version number in their name for easier identification in the Actions tab

## 1.3.6

**Bug Fix: ARM64 Initialization Failure + Documentation Overhaul**

- Fixed OpenCode failing to start on ARM64 devices (e.g. Home Assistant Green) — ARM64 was incorrectly routed into `baseline` mode even though no ARM64 baseline package exists, leaving the session with a non-existent binary path. ARM64 now correctly uses the regular OpenCode binary (reported by [@timsteinberg](https://github.com/timsteinberg) and [@wizzyto12](https://github.com/wizzyto12), fixed by [@Teeflo](https://github.com/Teeflo))
- Fixed potential infinite exec loop in the OpenCode wrapper when `/usr/local/bin/opencode` was already a symlink from a previous run (fixed by [@Teeflo](https://github.com/Teeflo))
- Added safe fallback in `opencode-session.sh` for the edge case where ARM64 baseline mode is manually forced via config (fixed by [@Teeflo](https://github.com/Teeflo))
- Revamped README with improved structure, clearer installation steps, and updated badges (contributed by [@Teeflo](https://github.com/Teeflo))
- Corrected MCP tool count (22 → 31), resource count (9 → 13), and added go-to-definition to the LSP feature description to reflect the actual implementation
- Updated icon and logo assets (contributed by [@Teeflo](https://github.com/Teeflo))

## 1.3.5

**Bug Fix: ARM64 Baseline Binary Initialization (fixes [#7](https://github.com/magnusoverli/ha_opencode/issues/7))**

- Fixed OpenCode failing to initialize on ARM64 devices (e.g. Home Assistant Green) when using the baseline binary
  - `OPENCODE_BIN_PATH` in `opencode-session.sh` was hardcoded to the x64 baseline path — now correctly resolves based on architecture
- Added proper ARM64 detection in CPU capability check, skipping the irrelevant x86 AVX flag inspection
- Fixed potential infinite exec loop in the OpenCode wrapper fallback path
- Thanks to [@timsteinberg](https://github.com/timsteinberg) and [@Teeflo](https://github.com/Teeflo) for reporting!

## 1.3.4

Re-tagged release to include the changelog in the published image (1.3.0–1.3.3 were built before the changelog was finalized).

## 1.3.3

**Architecture Refactor, CPU Compatibility, and Bug Fixes**

- Refactored s6 service architecture: initialization logic (directory setup, config generation, file deployment) now runs once in a dedicated `init-opencode` oneshot service, keeping the ttyd long-running service clean and focused
- Added CPU baseline detection for older processors without AVX2 support — the add-on now auto-detects CPU capabilities and selects the appropriate OpenCode binary (configurable via `cpu_mode`: auto/baseline/regular)
- Added custom OpenCode configuration injection — power users can now paste a JSON config in the add-on settings to customize OpenCode behavior (providers, keybindings, etc.)
- Fixed MCP `get_error_log` tool returning 404 errors by routing through the correct Supervisor proxy endpoint (`/core/api/error_log`)
- Fixed init-opencode oneshot service failing to execute (absolute path in `up` file)
- Fixed CPU auto-detection crashing on base image (replaced `grep -oP` with portable `awk`)
- Terminal banner now displays the actual add-on version instead of hardcoded "v1.0"

Inspired by work done in [okliam's fork](https://github.com/okliam). Thanks for exploring these ideas!
