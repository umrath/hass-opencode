## Configuration

Configure the app from the **Configuration** tab in the app page.

### Feature Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Enable MCP Home Assistant Integration** | `true` | Enable the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for deep Home Assistant integration. Includes 34 tools, 13 resources, 6 guided prompts, and an intelligence layer for anomaly detection, config validation, and automation suggestions. |
| **Enable LSP Home Assistant Integration** | `true` | Enable the Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for intelligent YAML editing. Provides entity/service autocomplete, hover documentation, diagnostics for unknown entities, and go-to-definition for !include tags. |
| **Screenshot Tool** | `false` | Enable visual verification of dashboards and UI pages. Uses headless Chromium to capture screenshots that vision-capable AI models can analyze. Requires a Long-Lived Access Token. See [Visual Verification](#visual-verification-screenshots). |
| **Enable PPQ Private TEE Models (Beta)** | `false` | Start an internal PPQ private-mode encryption proxy and add it as an OpenCode provider. Requires **PPQ API Key**. This feature is included in stable releases, but should still be considered beta. See [PPQ Private TEE Models (Beta)](#ppq-private-tee-models-beta). |
| **Enable OpenCode LAN Server** | `false` | Start an OpenCode server on internal port `4096` so clients on your local network can attach with the OpenCode CLI. Also requires mapping `4096/tcp` in the app Network settings. See [LAN Server Mode](#lan-server-mode). |
### Terminal Appearance

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Terminal Theme** | `breeze` | Color scheme for the terminal. Options: `breeze`, `catppuccin_mocha`, `catppuccin_latte`, `dracula`, `nord`, `tokyo_night`, `one_dark`, `solarized_dark`, `solarized_light`, `gruvbox_dark` |
| **Font Size** | `14` | Terminal font size in pixels (10-24) |
| **Cursor Style** | `block` | Cursor appearance: `block`, `underline`, or `bar` |
| **Blinking Cursor** | `false` | Whether the cursor should blink |

### Advanced Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU Mode** | `auto` | Controls which OpenCode binary is used. `auto` detects your CPU capabilities automatically (recommended). `baseline` forces the baseline binary for older CPUs without AVX2 support. `regular` forces the standard binary. |
| **OpenCode Update Policy** | `latest` | Controls how OpenCode itself is updated. `latest` installs and updates OpenCode in persistent app data so it can follow upstream releases independently of app releases. `bundled` uses only the OpenCode version included in the app image and disables OpenCode self-update. |
| **PPQ API Key** | `""` | API key for PPQ private-mode models. Stored as a masked app option and exported only to the internal PPQ proxy service. Only needed for the beta PPQ feature. |
| **Enable App Folder Guidance** | `false` | Shows terminal guidance for Home Assistant app development folders. The app mounts `/addons` and `/addon_configs` for development access; `/addon_configs` may contain sensitive app data. This option updates guidance after restart, but it is not a hard filesystem permission boundary. |
| **Zigbee2MQTT URL** | `""` | Optional URL for Zigbee2MQTT, used by zigporter commands such as `list-z2m` and `network-map --backend z2m`. Include `http://` or `https://`, for example `http://homeassistant.local:8099`. Host/IP-only values are treated as `http://`. |
| **Zigbee2MQTT MQTT Topic** | `zigbee2mqtt` | MQTT base topic used by Zigbee2MQTT. |
| **Serial Devices** | `[]` | Optional list of host UART/serial devices to map into the app. Use this for workflows that need direct serial access, such as local USB flashing or adapter inspection. |
| **Environment Variables** | `[]` | Define custom environment variables that are available to OpenCode and the terminal shell. Each entry has a `name` and `value`. Useful for provider credentials or configuration that must be set as environment variables (e.g. `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`). Changes take effect after restarting the app. Critical system variables (`HOME`, `PATH`, `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`, etc.) cannot be overridden. |
| **Custom OpenCode Configuration (JSON)** | `""` | Paste a JSON object to customize OpenCode's own configuration (providers, keybindings, etc.). This is merged with the app's built-in config. Leave empty for defaults. See [OpenCode config docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/config) for the full schema. |

### Resource Usage

OpenCode snapshots are disabled by default in this app to reduce memory and disk pressure on Home Assistant systems. File watching also ignores noisy internal paths such as `.storage/`, `.cloud/`, caches, logs, and the Home Assistant database. You can override these defaults with **Custom OpenCode Configuration (JSON)** if you need OpenCode's built-in snapshot/undo behavior.

### OpenCode Updates

By default, **OpenCode Update Policy** is set to `latest`. On startup, the app installs or updates `opencode-ai@latest` into `/data/.npm-global` and puts that persistent install first in `PATH`. OpenCode's own patch-level self-update also uses this persistent npm prefix, so upstream OpenCode updates can survive app restarts without requiring a new app release.

The app image still includes a bundled OpenCode copy as a fallback. If the startup update fails, the app logs a warning and continues with the existing persistent install or the bundled version.

Set **OpenCode Update Policy** to `bundled` to use only the OpenCode version included in the app image. This also disables OpenCode self-update and ignores any persistent OpenCode install under `/data/.npm-global`.

For x64 systems without visible AVX2 support, OpenCode selects its baseline binary. If this app runs in a VM on an AVX2-capable host, enable host CPU passthrough; generic QEMU/KVM CPU models can hide AVX2 and force the baseline binary unnecessarily. There is a known upstream baseline OOM issue tracked at `anomalyco/opencode#20988`.

#### Environment Variables Example

To set environment variables for an Azure OpenAI provider, add entries in the Configuration tab:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` | `my-azure-resource` |
| `AZURE_API_KEY` | `sk-...` |

After saving and restarting the app, these variables will be available in the terminal and to OpenCode. You can then use `/connect` inside OpenCode to configure your provider.

> **Note:** Environment variable values are stored on disk inside the container and are excluded from Home Assistant backups. However, they are visible in the app's Configuration tab. Treat them with the same care as any stored credential.

### PPQ Private TEE Models (Beta)

PPQ private mode routes OpenCode requests through a local encryption proxy before forwarding them to PPQ's private inference API. The proxy verifies the remote enclave, encrypts the request locally, and decrypts the response locally.

This feature is included in stable releases, but should still be considered beta while provider behavior and proxy integration are validated.

Flow:

```text
OpenCode -> 127.0.0.1:8787 PPQ proxy -> PPQ API -> remote TEE
```

To enable PPQ private models:

1. Get a PPQ API key from PPQ.
2. In the app **Configuration** tab, set **Enable PPQ Private TEE Models (Beta)** to `true`.
3. Paste the key into **PPQ API Key**. Alternatively, set `PPQ_API_KEY` through **Environment Variables** if you manage credentials that way.
4. Save and restart the app.
5. In OpenCode, select the `PPQ Private (TEE)` provider and one of the `private/...` models.

Security notes:

- The proxy binds only to `127.0.0.1:8787` inside the app container.
- No Home Assistant network port is exposed for PPQ private mode.
- The preferred PPQ API key path is the masked app option; `PPQ_API_KEY` in **Environment Variables** is also supported for advanced setups.
- The PPQ API key is not logged.
- The proxy package is pinned at image build time; the app does not run `npx latest` at startup.

Bundled model IDs come from the pinned `ppq-private-mode` package version:

| Model ID | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `private/kimi-k2-5` | Recommended fast general model, 262K context window |
| `private/deepseek-r1-0528` | Reasoning and analysis |
| `private/gpt-oss-120b` | Budget-friendly general use |
| `private/llama3-3-70b` | Open-source tasks |
| `private/qwen3-vl-30b` | Vision and text, 262K context window |

### Serial Devices

Serial access is disabled by default. To enable it, add one or more host serial devices to the `serial_devices` option in the app Configuration tab, then restart the app. Home Assistant Supervisor validates those paths and maps only the selected devices into the container.

OpenCode and terminal commands can then use paths such as `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `/dev/ttyACM0`, or stable `/dev/serial/by-id/...` paths when they are provided by the host. The selected paths are also exported as `OPENCODE_SERIAL_DEVICES` using `:` as the separator.

The Supervisor `uart` and `udev` manifest flags remain disabled by default. They are static app manifest permissions rather than regular user options, so they cannot be toggled from the app Configuration tab.

### LAN Server Mode

LAN server mode lets you attach to the Home Assistant-hosted OpenCode session from a terminal outside the Home Assistant UI.

To enable LAN access:

1. In the app **Configuration** tab, set **Enable OpenCode LAN Server** to `true`.
2. In the app **Network** settings, map `4096/tcp` to the host port you want to use.
3. Save and restart the app.

On the secondary computer, use `opencode attach` with your Home Assistant host IP and configured port:

```bash
opencode attach http://<home-assistant-ip>:<mapped-host-port>
```

Example, if you mapped `4096/tcp` to host port `4096`:

```bash
opencode attach http://192.168.1.50:4096
```

The app log shows the current Home Assistant port mapping when the server starts, for example `Home Assistant port mapping: 4096/tcp -> 3443`. If OpenCode also prints `opencode server listening on http://0.0.0.0:4096`, that is the internal container listener, not the URL to use from another computer. Use your Home Assistant host and the mapped host port instead.

Security warning: enabling this service and mapping the port exposes an OpenCode server on your LAN. Only use this on trusted networks, restrict access with your network/firewall controls, and never expose the port to the internet or untrusted networks.

## Getting Started

### 1. Open the App

Click on **OpenCode** in the Home Assistant sidebar to open the terminal.

### 2. Configure Your AI Provider

OpenCode needs an AI provider to function. Run the following command inside OpenCode:

```
opencode
```

Then use the `/connect` command to add your AI provider:

```
/connect
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate with your preferred provider:
- **Anthropic** (Claude) - Recommended
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4)
- **Google** (Gemini)
- **OpenCode Zen** - Curated models optimized for coding
- And many more...

### 3. Start Coding!

Once connected, you can ask OpenCode to help with your Home Assistant configuration:

```
Help me create an automation that turns on the lights when motion is detected
```

```
Review my configuration.yaml for any issues
```

```
Add a template sensor for my energy usage
```

## Copy and Paste

The web terminal supports the system clipboard in both directions:

**Copying out of the terminal**

- **Inside OpenCode**: select text with the mouse (or use OpenCode's copy keybinds) — the selection is sent to your clipboard automatically.
- **In the shell**: click and drag to select — the text is copied the moment you release (a ✂ icon flashes to confirm).
- **While a full-screen app captures the mouse** (OpenCode, `htop`, etc.) you can always force a browser-side selection with **Shift+drag** (Windows/Linux) or **Option+drag** (macOS).

> **Note:** Browsers only allow silent clipboard writes on secure (HTTPS) connections. If you access Home Assistant over plain HTTP (e.g. `http://homeassistant.local:8123`), copying inside OpenCode shows a **"📋 Copy to clipboard"** button in the corner of the terminal instead — click it once to complete the copy. Shell drag-to-copy works without the extra click either way.

**Pasting into the terminal**

- **Ctrl+V** (or **Cmd+V** on macOS)
- **Right-click → Paste**, **Ctrl+Shift+V**, or **Shift+Insert** also work

In the Home Assistant companion apps the embedded browser is more restricted than a regular browser; if a paste shortcut does nothing there, use the right-click/long-press paste menu.

---

## Safe Config Writing

The `write_config_safe` MCP tool provides a complete validation pipeline when writing Home Assistant YAML configuration files. Instead of blind file writes, every change goes through multiple safety checks — including content protection against accidental data loss — with automatic rollback on failure.

### Validation Pipeline

When you (or the AI agent) write configuration through `write_config_safe`, the following steps happen automatically:

1. **Path security** — Resolves the target path and blocks writes outside the config directory (no traversal attacks, no writes to `.storage/`, `deps/`, `tts/`, etc.)
2. **Deprecation scan** — Checks the YAML content against known deprecation patterns sourced from:
   - A bundled pattern library (20+ patterns covering entity namespaces, MQTT changes, YAML config removal, etc.)
   - Remote pattern updates fetched from GitHub (cached for 1 hour)
   - Your instance's live **Repairs** issues (via the HA WebSocket API)
   - The public **HA Alerts** feed (integration-level advisories with version ranges)
3. **Structural validation** — Verifies that automations have `trigger` + `action`, scripts have `sequence`, template sensors have `state`, and other structural requirements are met
4. **Jinja2 template validation** — Extracts all `{{ }}` and `{% %}` blocks and validates them against HA's template rendering engine. Templates containing runtime-only variables (`trigger.*`, `this.*`, `context.*`, etc.) are skipped since they can't be validated outside their execution context
5. **Content protection** — Compares the new content against the existing file to prevent accidental data loss:
   - **List-entry reduction** — For `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, and `scenes.yaml`, blocks writes that would reduce the number of top-level list entries
   - **Top-level key preservation** — For mapping-based files like `configuration.yaml`, blocks writes that would remove existing top-level keys
   - **Significant size reduction** — For all files, blocks writes that would reduce the file by more than 50% by line count
   - All three checks can be bypassed with `confirm_deletions: true` for intentional removals
6. **File write with backup** — Creates a `.bak` copy of the existing file before writing the new content. The backup is retained even after a successful write as a recovery point
7. **HA Core config check** — Calls Home Assistant's configuration validation API to catch errors that static analysis can't
8. **Auto-restore on failure** — If the config check fails, the backup is automatically restored and the error is reported

### Dry Run Mode

Pass `dry_run: true` to run the full validation pipeline without actually writing the file. This is useful for checking whether proposed changes would pass validation before committing to them.

```
Check if this automation YAML is valid without saving it
```

### What Gets Reported

The tool returns a structured result with:

- **`success`** — Whether the write (or dry run) passed all checks
- **`deprecations`** — Any deprecated patterns found, with descriptions and suggested replacements
- **`structuralIssues`** — Missing required keys or structural problems
- **`templateErrors`** — Jinja2 template syntax or rendering errors
- **`configCheckResult`** — Output from HA Core's config validation
- **`backupPath`** — Path to the backup file (if a write occurred)

---

## Visual Verification (Screenshots)

The `screenshot_url` MCP tool lets the AI visually verify changes to dashboards and other HA frontend pages. After creating or modifying a dashboard view via `hab`, the AI can take a screenshot to confirm the result looks correct.

### How It Works

1. A headless Chromium browser launches inside the app container
2. It authenticates with the HA frontend using your Long-Lived Access Token
3. Navigates to the requested page and waits for it to render
4. Captures a PNG screenshot and returns it to the AI model
5. Vision-capable AI models (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, etc.) can analyze the image

### Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Add-ons → OpenCode → Configuration**
2. Enable **"Screenshot tool"**
3. Set a **Long-Lived Access Token** (create one at Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens)
4. Restart the app

### Usage Examples

```
Create a new dashboard for the living room and show me what it looks like
```

```
Take a screenshot of my energy dashboard
```

```
Add a weather card to the overview and verify it looks right
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|

### Notes

- The screenshot tool adds Chromium to the container image, increasing its size
- Each screenshot takes approximately 5-10 seconds (browser launch + page load + render wait)
- Screenshots are only taken when the AI explicitly calls the tool — no background processes
- The Long-Lived Access Token is the same one used for ESPHome tools

## LSP Integration (Intelligent YAML Editing)

The app includes a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server that provides intelligent editing features for Home Assistant YAML configuration files. This is **enabled by default** because it only reads data and doesn't modify anything.

### What is LSP?

LSP (Language Server Protocol) is a standard that enables smart editor features like:
- Autocomplete suggestions
- Hover documentation
- Go-to-definition
- Error diagnostics

The OpenCode LSP server connects to your Home Assistant instance and provides context-aware assistance while you edit YAML files.

### LSP Features

#### Entity ID Autocomplete

When typing `entity_id:`, you get suggestions from all entities in your Home Assistant:

```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: # <-- Type here and get all your entities!
```

The autocomplete shows:
- Entity ID (e.g., `light.living_room`)
- Friendly name (e.g., "Living Room Light")
- Current state (e.g., "on")
- Device class if available

#### Service Autocomplete

When typing `service:` or `action:`, you get all available services:

```yaml
action:
  - service: # <-- Type here to see all services!
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

Service completions include:
- Full service name (e.g., `light.turn_on`)
- Description
- Available fields/parameters

#### Area & Device Completion

Complete area and device IDs:

```yaml
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      area_id: # <-- Suggests all your areas
```

#### Jinja2 Template Completion

Inside `{{ }}` templates, get function completions:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      living_room_temp:
        value_template: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') }}"
        #                   ^ Autocomplete Jinja functions and entities
```

Available completions:
- `states('entity_id')` - Get entity state
- `is_state('entity_id', 'state')` - Check state
- `state_attr('entity_id', 'attr')` - Get attribute
- `now()`, `today_at()`, `as_timestamp()` - Time functions
- `area_entities('area')`, `device_entities('device')` - Relationship functions

#### Hover Information

Hover over entity IDs to see detailed information:

```yaml
entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
#          ^ Hover here to see:
#            - Friendly name: "Living Room Temperature"
#            - State: "21.5"
#            - Unit: "°C"
#            - All attributes
```

Hover over Jinja2 templates to see the **live rendered result**:

```yaml
value_template: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') | float }}"
#               ^ Hover to see: "21.5"
```

#### Diagnostics (Warnings & Errors)

The LSP shows warnings for potential issues:

**Unknown Entity Warning:**
```yaml
entity_id: sensor.does_not_exist
#          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#          ⚠ Unknown entity: sensor.does_not_exist
```

**Unknown Service Warning:**
```yaml
service: light.invalid_service
#        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#        ⚠ Unknown service: light.invalid_service
```

**Missing Include Error:**
```yaml
automation: !include missing_file.yaml
#                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#                    ❌ Include file not found: missing_file.yaml
```

**Deprecation Warning:**
```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        #~~~~~~~~
        # ⚠ Deprecated: "service" is deprecated, use "action" instead (since 2024.x)
```

Deprecation patterns are loaded from a bundled pattern library and refreshed from GitHub in the background. Warnings appear as yellow squigglies in the editor as you type.

#### Go-to-Definition

Click on `!include` references to jump to the included file:

```yaml
automation: !include automations.yaml
#                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#                    Ctrl+Click to open automations.yaml
```

Also works with `!secret`:
```yaml
api_key: !secret api_key
#               ~~~~~~~~
#               Ctrl+Click to open secrets.yaml
```

### Trigger & Condition Completion

When editing automations, get completions for:

**Trigger Platforms:**
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: # state, numeric_state, time, sun, zone, mqtt, webhook...
```

**Condition Types:**
```yaml
condition:
  - condition: # state, numeric_state, time, sun, zone, template, and, or, not...
```

**Action Keys:**
```yaml
action:
  - service:     # Service to call
    target:      # Target entities/areas/devices
    data:        # Service parameters
  - delay:       # Delay before next action
  - wait_template: # Wait for condition
  - choose:      # Conditional branching
  - repeat:      # Repeat actions
```

### Configuration

LSP is enabled by default. To disable it:

1. Go to the app **Configuration** tab
2. Set **"Enable LSP Home Assistant Integration"** to `false`
3. Restart the app

### Technical Notes

- The LSP server caches entity/service data for 60 seconds for performance
- Cache is automatically refreshed when stale
- Works even without Home Assistant connection (limited features)
- YAML syntax validation is always available

---

## Working Directory

OpenCode starts in the `/homeassistant` directory, which is your Home Assistant configuration folder. This includes:

- `configuration.yaml`
- `automations.yaml`
- `scripts.yaml`
- `scenes.yaml`
- Custom components in `custom_components/`
- And all other configuration files

When app folder guidance is enabled, the terminal also highlights `/addons` and `/addon_configs` for Home Assistant app development. These folders are mounted into the container for development access. Treat `/addon_configs` as sensitive because it may contain configuration data for other apps.

## Customizing AI Instructions (AGENTS.md)

The app creates an `AGENTS.md` file in your Home Assistant config directory (`/homeassistant/AGENTS.md`) on first install. This file contains instructions that guide how OpenCode behaves when working with your Home Assistant setup.

### Default Instructions Include:

- **User consent rules** - The AI won't make changes without your explicit approval
- **Home Assistant knowledge** - File structure, YAML syntax, automation patterns
- **Safety guidelines** - Protection for secrets, backup reminders, validation checks
- **MCP awareness** - How to use MCP tools when available

### Customizing the Instructions

You can edit `AGENTS.md` to add your own rules or context:

1. Open **File Editor** (or VS Code Server app)
2. Navigate to `/config/AGENTS.md`
3. Add your customizations

**Example additions:**

```markdown
## My Home Setup

- I use Zigbee2MQTT for all Zigbee devices
- My house has 3 floors: basement, main, upstairs
- Prefer MQTT automations over native HA automations
- Always use packages for new configuration

## Coding Preferences

- Use descriptive entity_id names with room prefix
- Add comments explaining automation logic
- Prefer template sensors over Node-RED
```

### Resetting to Default

If you want to restore the default `AGENTS.md`:

1. Delete or rename the existing file
2. Restart the app
3. A fresh default will be created

## Tips

### Validating Configuration

After making changes, you can ask OpenCode to validate your configuration:

```
Check if my configuration is valid
```

With MCP enabled, OpenCode calls the validation API directly and reports any errors.

For a more thorough check, ask OpenCode to use the safe config writer which runs the full validation pipeline (deprecation scan, structural checks, template validation, and HA Core config check):

```
Write this automation to automations.yaml using safe config writing
```

```
Dry-run validate my configuration.yaml without saving
```

See [Safe Config Writing](#safe-config-writing) for full details on the validation pipeline.

### Viewing Logs

If something isn't working, check the logs:

```
Show me the recent error logs
```

Or use the helper command:

```bash
ha-logs error
```

### Git Integration

OpenCode works well with git. If you version control your configuration:

```
Show me what files have changed
```

```
Commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

### Using Semantic Summaries

Instead of raw JSON data, ask for summaries:

```
Give me a summary of all entity states
```

This returns a human-readable overview organized by domain, including any detected anomalies.

## Data Storage

Your OpenCode sessions and API credentials are stored in `/data/` within the app. This data:

- **Is backed up** when you create a Home Assistant backup
- **Persists** across app restarts and updates
- **Is private** to your Home Assistant instance

## Security Notes

- This app has access to your Home Assistant configuration files (read/write)
- This app mounts `/addons` and `/addon_configs` for app development access. `/addon_configs` may contain sensitive data from other apps.
- This app can view system logs (Core, Supervisor, Host)
- When MCP is enabled, OpenCode can query entities and call services
- Access is protected by Home Assistant authentication via ingress
- Only users with access to the OpenCode panel can use this app

## Troubleshooting

### OpenCode won't start

Check if you have enough memory. If the terminal shows `Killed`, check host logs for the Linux OOM killer:

```bash
ha-logs host 300 | grep -i "out of memory\|oom\|opencode"
```

OpenCode can use significant memory on larger Home Assistant installations. This app disables OpenCode snapshots by default and ignores noisy internal paths to reduce memory pressure, but systems with limited RAM or full swap may still need more available memory.

### Can't connect to AI provider

1. Make sure you have internet access
2. Run `/connect` again to re-authenticate
3. Check that your API key or subscription is valid

### Terminal not loading

1. Try refreshing the page
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Check the app logs in the Home Assistant Supervisor

### Copy/paste not working

1. See the [Copy and Paste](#copy-and-paste) section for the supported shortcuts
2. On plain HTTP connections, copying inside OpenCode requires clicking the "📋 Copy to clipboard" button that appears — browsers forbid silent clipboard writes without HTTPS
3. To copy from full-screen apps that capture the mouse, hold **Shift** while dragging (**Option** on macOS)
4. The companion apps' embedded browser is more restricted than a regular browser — if shortcuts fail there, open Home Assistant in a normal browser

### MCP not working

1. Make sure MCP is enabled: `ha-mcp status`
2. Restart OpenCode after enabling MCP
3. Test the connection: `ha-mcp test`
4. Check that the app has API access (it should by default)

### Entity not found in MCP queries

1. Verify the entity exists in Home Assistant
2. Check the exact entity_id spelling
3. Use `search_entities` to find entities by name

### Changes not taking effect

After modifying configuration files, you may need to:

1. Validate: **Developer Tools** > **YAML** > **Check Configuration**
2. Reload: **Developer Tools** > **YAML** > **Reload** the relevant domain
3. Or restart Home Assistant for major changes
