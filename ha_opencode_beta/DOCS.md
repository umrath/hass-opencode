# OpenCode Beta

This is the **beta channel** for the OpenCode app. It contains experimental features and fixes that are being validated before inclusion in the stable release.

**You can install this alongside the stable OpenCode app.** Both will appear in the sidebar (as "OpenCode" and "OpenCode Beta") and operate independently.

## Current Beta Changes

- **Beta baseline reset**: `1.9.0b0` is based on the current stable OpenCode app release and does not include beta-only feature changes yet.
- **Serial device access**: Selected host UART/serial devices can be mapped into the app for USB flashing and adapter inspection workflows. Full Supervisor `uart` and `udev` manifest flags remain disabled by default because they are static permissions, not runtime user options.
- **Optional LAN server mode**: You can now enable an OpenCode server bound to `0.0.0.0` so other computers on your local network can connect directly.
- **PPQ private TEE models**: Opt-in encrypted proxy for PPQ private models running in remote TEEs. The proxy is internal-only and binds to `127.0.0.1` inside the app container.
- **Web terminal clipboard fixes**: Copying inside OpenCode now reaches the browser clipboard, plain `Ctrl+V` paste works, and macOS users can use `Option+drag` to select text while full-screen terminal apps capture the mouse.
- **OpenCode update policy**: The app can keep OpenCode updated in persistent app data (`latest`) or use only the image-bundled version (`bundled`).

## Add-on Folder Access

OpenCode mounts `/addons` and `/addon_configs` for Home Assistant app development access. Enable **Add-on Folder Guidance** in the app configuration and restart to show these paths in the terminal. This option updates guidance, but the mounts are static app metadata and are not a hard filesystem permission boundary.

Treat `/addon_configs` as sensitive because it may contain configuration data for other apps.

## Resource Usage

OpenCode snapshots are disabled by default in this app to reduce memory and disk pressure on Home Assistant systems. File watching also ignores noisy internal paths such as `.storage/`, `.cloud/`, caches, logs, and the Home Assistant database. You can override these defaults with **Custom OpenCode Configuration (JSON)** if you need OpenCode's built-in snapshot/undo behavior.

## OpenCode Updates

By default, **OpenCode Update Policy** is set to `latest`. The app installs or updates OpenCode in `/data/.npm-global` and uses that persistent install before the image-bundled fallback. Set the policy to `bundled` to use only the OpenCode version included in the app image and disable OpenCode self-update.

For x64 VM installs, make sure the guest can see AVX2 when the host supports it. Generic QEMU/KVM CPU models can hide AVX2 and force OpenCode's baseline binary.

## Zigbee2MQTT URL

If you configure `z2m_url` for zigporter commands, use a full URL such as `http://homeassistant.local:8099`. Host/IP-only values are accepted and treated as `http://`.

## LAN Server Mode (Beta)

LAN server mode lets you attach to the Home Assistant-hosted OpenCode session from a terminal outside the Home Assistant UI.

To enable LAN access:

1. In the app **Configuration** tab, set **Enable OpenCode LAN Server** to `true`.
2. In the app **Network** settings, map `4096/tcp` to the host port you want to use.
3. Save and restart the app.

On the secondary computer, use `opencode attach` with your Home Assistant host IP and configured port:

```bash
opencode attach http://<home-assistant-ip>:<mapped-host-port>
```

Example, if you mapped `4096/tcp` to host port `4096`:

```bash
opencode attach http://192.168.1.50:4096
```

The app log shows the current Home Assistant port mapping when the server starts, for example `Home Assistant port mapping: 4096/tcp -> 3443`. If OpenCode also prints `opencode server listening on http://0.0.0.0:4096`, that is the internal container listener, not the URL to use from another computer. Use your Home Assistant host and the mapped host port instead.

Security warning: enabling this service and mapping the port exposes an OpenCode server on your LAN. Only use this on trusted networks, restrict access with your network/firewall controls, and never expose the port to the internet or untrusted networks.

## PPQ Private TEE Models (Beta)

PPQ private mode routes OpenCode requests through a local encryption proxy before forwarding them to PPQ's private inference API. The proxy verifies the remote enclave, encrypts the request locally, and decrypts the response locally.

To enable PPQ private models:

1. Get a PPQ API key from PPQ.
2. In the app **Configuration** tab, set **Enable PPQ Private TEE Models** to `true`.
3. Paste the key into **PPQ API Key**. Alternatively, set `PPQ_API_KEY` through **Environment Variables** if you manage credentials that way.
4. Save and restart the app.
5. In OpenCode, select the `PPQ Private (TEE)` provider and one of the `private/...` models.

Security notes:

- The proxy binds only to `127.0.0.1:8787` inside the app container.
- No Home Assistant network port is exposed for PPQ private mode.
- The PPQ API key is not logged.
- The proxy package is pinned at image build time; the app does not run `npx latest` at startup.

Bundled model IDs come from the pinned `ppq-private-mode` package version: `private/kimi-k2-5`, `private/deepseek-r1-0528`, `private/gpt-oss-120b`, `private/llama3-3-70b`, and `private/qwen3-vl-30b`.
