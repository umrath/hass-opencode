# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Manifest sync with stable** — Bumped version to 2.2.32b0, added `tmpfs: true`, updated image and source URLs from magnusoverli to umrath.

## 2.1.1b0

- **OpenCode runtime update policy** — added a `latest`/`bundled` update policy. By default the add-on installs `opencode-ai@latest` into persistent add-on data and uses that before the bundled fallback, while `bundled` disables OpenCode self-update and uses the image version only. Baseline CPU mode now logs VM CPU passthrough guidance and the known upstream baseline OOM issue.

## 2.0.3b7

- **Web terminal clipboard fixes** — copying inside OpenCode now reaches the browser clipboard via OSC 52 support through tmux and a custom ttyd page, with a one-click fallback on plain HTTP. Plain `Ctrl+V` paste now works, and macOS users can use `Option+drag` to select text while full-screen terminal apps capture the mouse.

## 2.0.3b6

- **Lower MCP server memory** — `puppeteer-core` is now loaded on first screenshot use instead of at startup, saving ~28 MB of resident memory per MCP server process when the screenshot tool is unused (the default).

## 2.0.3b5

- **Native ARM64 builds** — the aarch64 image now builds on GitHub's native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners instead of QEMU emulation, cutting ARM build times from ~20 minutes to roughly amd64 speed. The QEMU setup step is removed from the build workflows.
- **Cross-platform hab build stage** — the hab CLI builder stage is pinned to the build platform and cross-compiles via `GOARCH`, so it runs natively regardless of target architecture.
- No add-on functionality changes.

## 2.0.3b4

- **Node 24-ready CI** — all GitHub Actions in the build and release workflows bumped to Node 24 runtimes (checkout v6, docker setup-qemu/setup-buildx/login v4, build-push v7, action-gh-release v3) ahead of GitHub's enforced runtime switch on June 16, 2026. No add-on functionality changes — the image is rebuilt from the same source as 2.0.3b3.

## 2.0.3b3

Performance release — startup, MCP tool, and YAML LSP latency.

- **Faster startup** — Zigbee2MQTT/ESPHome discovery now runs in the background instead of blocking boot, AGENTS.md help injection only re-runs after add-on updates, the baseline OpenCode binary ships in the image (amd64), and user env vars are processed in a single pass.
- **Faster MCP tools** — timeouts on all API and documentation fetches, 10-minute backoff for failed remote fetches (removes up to 15 s per config write on offline installs), concurrent template validation with dry-run result reuse in `write_config_safe`, cached ESPHome discovery and ingress sessions, a short-lived entity state cache, WebSocket registry calls for areas/devices instead of slow Jinja templates, a persistent screenshot browser, and compact, capped output for large responses.
- **Faster YAML LSP** — completion documentation resolves lazily and space no longer triggers completion (far smaller payloads on large installs), HA fetches time out and serve cached data while refreshing in the background, and diagnostics debounce per document with stale results dropped.
- **Fixes** — `get_error_log` returned 404 due to a doubled API path; service hover in the YAML LSP was unreachable; editing one file no longer cancels another file's pending diagnostics.
- **Behavior** — unfiltered `get_services` now returns a domain/service index (pass `domain` for full schemas); `get_history` defaults to minimal responses (pass `minimal: false` for full attributes).
- **Smaller image** — checked-in dev `node_modules` are no longer baked into the Docker image.

## 2.0.3b2

- **GitHub Release image assets** — multi-arch build workflows now attach `container-images.md` and `image-manifest.txt` to the matching GitHub Release after publishing the GHCR image manifest, making the published image references and manifest details visible from the release page.

## 2.0.3b1

- **Multi-arch image publishing** — migrated the beta add-on to Home Assistant's preferred generic multi-arch image style (`ghcr.io/magnusoverli/ha_opencode_beta`) while keeping legacy arch-specific image aliases for compatibility.
- **Multi-arch Debian base image** — switched from architecture-prefixed Home Assistant Debian base images to `ghcr.io/home-assistant/base-debian:trixie`, which resolves to the same Debian Trixie amd64/arm64 platform images.

## 2.0.3b0

- **PPQ private TEE models** — added an opt-in internal PPQ private-mode proxy, pinned at image build time, with a masked PPQ API key option and an OpenCode custom provider for PPQ private models. The proxy binds only to `127.0.0.1` inside the container and is not exposed through Home Assistant networking.

## 2.0.0b1

- Mask the Home Assistant access token field in the add-on configuration UI.

## 2.0.0b0

- **Optional LAN server mode** — added an opt-in beta setting that starts an OpenCode server on fixed internal port `4096`, with Home Assistant Network settings controlling any host port mapping. This allows remote clients to connect with `opencode attach` when the port is explicitly mapped.

## 1.9.0b1

- Improve Zigbee2MQTT URL configuration by documenting the required `http://` or `https://` scheme and automatically treating host/IP-only `z2m_url` values as `http://`.
- Add Home Assistant add-on development folder access by mounting `/addons` and `/addon_configs`, with an opt-in guidance setting and security warnings.

## 1.9.0b0

- Reset the beta channel baseline to the current stable OpenCode add-on release.
- No beta-only feature changes are included in this baseline release.

## 1.7.3b0

- **Fix: screenshot_url no longer always times out** — `waitUntil: "networkidle0"` was used for page navigation, which waits for zero active network connections. The HA frontend keeps a persistent WebSocket open (`/api/websocket`) for the lifetime of the page, so this condition was never satisfied and every screenshot timed out after 30 seconds. Changed to `waitUntil: "load"`, which fires once the page and its subresources are fetched and ignores ongoing connections. Dynamic content rendering is already handled by the existing `wait_seconds` delay. Fixes [#19](https://github.com/magnusoverli/opencode/issues/19)

## 1.7.0b7

- **Fix: screenshot tool now authenticates correctly** — the previous approach only used localStorage with an empty `refresh_token` (falsy in JS), causing the HA frontend to show the login page instead of the dashboard. Now uses three complementary auth strategies:
  1. localStorage injection with non-empty `refresh_token`
  2. WebSocket monkey-patch that auto-responds to `auth_required`
  3. HTTP request interception adding `Authorization` header to HA server requests (token is not sent to external URLs)

## 1.7.0b6

- **Fix: screenshot_enabled config option and translation now synced to main** — the release workflow was only sed-bumping the version in config.yaml without syncing schema changes or translations. Now syncs the entire `ha_opencode_beta/` directory from the tagged commit to main
- This is the same Docker image as b5 — only the repository metadata sync is fixed

## 1.7.0b5

- **Fix: screenshot_enabled option now visible in Configuration UI** — was missing a translation entry in `translations/en.yaml`, causing HA to hide it
- Updated access token description to mention screenshot tool

## 1.7.0b4

- **New `screenshot_url` MCP tool** — visual verification of HA frontend pages using headless Chromium. After making dashboard changes via hab, the AI can take a screenshot and analyze it with vision. Requires `screenshot_enabled` option and a Long-Lived Access Token (opt-in, disabled by default)
- **`discoverHACoreUrl()` utility** — extracted HA Core URL discovery into a reusable function (used by both screenshot and ESPHome features)
- Chromium and puppeteer-core added to container image
- MCP server bumped to v2.7.0 (34 tools)
- Beta release workflow updated to use `dev` branch

## 1.7.0b2

- **write_config_safe: generalized content protection** — blocks writes that
  would remove top-level keys from mapping files (e.g. `configuration.yaml`)
  or significantly shrink any config file. Addresses [#14](https://github.com/magnusoverli/opencode/issues/14)
- `.bak` files are now retained after successful writes as a recovery point

## 1.6.1b16

- **Fix `hab esphome` commands from shell** — root cause: `HAB_ESPHOME_URL` and
  `HAB_ESPHOME_SESSION` were never set in the shell environment. The MCP server
  discovers these at runtime for its own `hab_run` tool, but shell users got
  "authentication failed" because hab had no ESPHome credentials.
- New `discover-esphome.js` startup script replicates the MCP server's 5-step
  ESPHome discovery flow (find addon → get ingress entry → resolve HA Core URL →
  create WebSocket ingress session → build final URL) and writes the resulting
  `HAB_ESPHOME_URL` and `HAB_ESPHOME_SESSION` exports to `/data/.env_vars`
- Discovery runs at addon startup (best-effort) — if ESPHome is not installed,
  not running, or the access token is missing/invalid, it skips silently
- Picks up latest HAB CLI from main branch (built from source at image build time)

## 1.6.1b15

- **Final beta before stable release**
- Picks up latest HAB CLI changes from main branch (built from source at
  image build time) — includes upstream improvements for addon support
- AGENTS.md: safer automation editing workflow — AI must now read and
  preserve all existing automations before writing, with explicit warning
  against overwriting `automations.yaml`

## 1.6.1b14

- Fix doubled ingress path in URL construction — `ingress_entry` from the
  Supervisor already contains `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>`, so the code was
  producing `http://host:8123/api/hassio_ingress//api/hassio_ingress/<token>/...`
  which returned 404. Now correctly appends the entry path directly to the
  HA Core base URL.

## 1.6.1b13

- Enhanced error reporting for ESPHome device requests
  - On failure: shows full URL, HTTP status, response body, headers sent,
    plus all discovery steps and constructed ingress URL
  - On success: shows ingress URL and URL source in device list output
  - This will reveal whether the 404 is from HA Core's ingress proxy or ESPHome

## 1.6.1b12

- Fix ESPHome addon detection — Supervisor `/addons` API does not set
  `installed: true`; check `state` and `version` fields instead
  - This was the root cause of the MCP tool reporting "not installed"
    even though ESPHome was running
- Discovery now proceeds past addon detection to attempt the full ingress flow

## 1.6.1b11

- Add detailed step-by-step diagnostics to ESPHome discovery
  - `discoverESPHome()` now returns structured diagnostics showing exactly which
    step failed (addon lookup, addon info, access token, URL discovery, network
    fallback, WebSocket session creation)
  - `esphome_list_devices` tool shows full discovery step trace on failure
  - `esphome_compile` and `esphome_upload` show step summary on failure
  - `hab_run` logs step detail for ESPHome pre-discovery failures
  - No more generic "not installed or not accessible" — the exact failure point
    and all intermediate data (interfaces, URLs, slugs) are surfaced

## 1.6.1b10

- Test with HAB CLI reverted to known working state
  - No HAB CLI changes — using upstream as-is
  - MCP server unchanged from b9 (network fallback + WebSocket session creation)
  - Isolates whether the b9 500 errors were caused by HAB CLI changes

## 1.6.1b8

- Simplify HAB CLI changes — revert all discovery-path code, keep only
  `GetESPHomeClient` env var handling (HA_ACCESS_TOKEN + HAB_ESPHOME_SESSION)
  since the MCP server handles all URL/session discovery

## 1.6.1b7

- Support "automatic" internal_url setting (most common HA default)
  - When `/api/config` returns `internal_url: null`, fall back to discovering the
    host's LAN IP from Supervisor's `/network/info` (primary connected interface)
    and Core port from `/core/info`
  - No longer requires manually setting internal_url in HA Network settings

## 1.6.1b6

- Use WebSocket for ingress session creation (REST path rejected by Supervisor)
  - REST `POST /api/hassio/ingress/session` is always rejected — only the WebSocket
    `supervisor/api` command works (HA Core makes the call with its own credentials)
  - MCP server: new `createIngressSessionViaWebSocket()` function
  - HAB CLI: delegates to `discoverESPHomeViaWebSocket()` (same path as external CLI)
  - Still uses `internal_url` from `/api/config` + long-lived access token

## 1.6.1b5

- Use HA Core's real LAN URL instead of Docker-internal hostnames
  - Auto-discovers `internal_url` from `/api/config` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8123`)
  - Routes ingress through the same URL path the external CLI uses
  - Docker hostnames (`homeassistant`, `supervisor`) don't work for ingress from addon containers

## 1.6.1b4

- Add `access_token` config option for HA Core long-lived access token
  - Required for ESPHome ingress (SUPERVISOR_TOKEN is not accepted by HA Core directly)
  - Create at: HA UI → Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens
  - Paste into addon Configuration → `access_token`
- Use HA access token for all HA Core direct calls (session creation + ingress requests)
- Clear error message when access token is missing and ESPHome tools are used

## 1.6.1b3

- Bypass Supervisor proxy entirely for ESPHome ingress
  - Route directly to HA Core at `http://homeassistant:8123` (Docker internal hostname)
  - Session: `POST http://homeassistant:8123/api/hassio/ingress/session`
  - Requests: `http://homeassistant:8123/api/hassio_ingress/{entry}/...`
  - Matches the code path that works from outside HA with a long-lived token

## 1.6.1b2

- Fix ESPHome ingress session creation (was returning 403)
  - Route session creation and requests through HA Core proxy instead of Supervisor directly
  - Session: `POST /core/api/hassio/ingress/session`
  - Requests: `/core/api/hassio_ingress/{entry}/...`

## 1.6.1b1

- Fix ESPHome addon connectivity from OpenCode
  - Route MCP tools and hab CLI through Supervisor ingress proxy
  - ESPHome dashboard requests now originate from Supervisor IP (allowed by nginx)
  - Add ingress session authentication for proxied requests
- Bump hassio_role to manager for ingress session creation
